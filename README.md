Sentinel-Based Soil Moisture Analysis

This project analyzes soil moisture trends in Mehsana, Gujarat (India) from 2019 to 2023 using Sentinel-1 SAR data and evaluates its relationship with vegetation health (NDVI from Sentinel-2). It uses Google Earth Engine (GEE) and QGIS for preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

📌 Overview

Region: Mehsana, Gujarat

Data: Sentinel-1 VV polarization (SAR), Sentinel-2 NDVI

Tools: Python, Google Earth Engine, QGIS

🔍 Key Features

Created a 5-year soil moisture time series using Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter

Detected seasonal patterns, long-term trends, and anomalies using statistical methods

Computed NDVI from Sentinel-2 and established correlation with soil moisture

Visualized changes through animated QGIS maps and dual-axis NDVI–SMI plots

📈 Results

Soil moisture shows a slight upward trend over 5 years

Strong seasonal variation aligned with monsoon cycles

Positive correlation found between soil moisture and NDVI, supporting crop growth insights
